         Or rather how many encounters have I had with cows. Right when it was time for me to travel for the first time to Sheridan, Wyoming –no explanation needed–, I shared with my friends, candidly, that I had only seen cows what... once? twice? in my life. They GASPED, of course, cause they seem to believe cows are everywhere. As if they were an obtainable being they can get access to whenever. As if they were there for us, for all of us.        
        </p>
        
        <p>
          And now, I'm curious. Is it me? Is it my friends? Is it the cows? What is keeping me away from them? So... I'd like to keep count from now on.
